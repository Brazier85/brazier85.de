## What are "dotfiles"?
So, if you're running a Linux or Unix system, you’ve probably noticed some files hanging around in your profile that start with a `.`—like `.gitconfig`. These are configuration files for various programs. There are also folders like `.config` floating around. All of these files and folders? Yep, they're called "dotfiles."

## Why should we care about them?
Well, dotfiles are the secret sauce for all your program configurations. If you're planning on jumping to a new system, or if you're like me and enjoy hopping between different Linux distros every other week, dotfiles make life way easier. With a set of pre-configured dotfiles, you can move your setup to a new machine without losing your mind (or your settings).

## What I use
I keep my dotfiles in a GitHub repository—*but wait, it’s not just my dotfiles in there*. This repo also handles bootstrapping my system. That’s my fancy way of saying I have scripts that automatically install my go-to programs and configurations. In theory, all I have to do is run my `bootstrap.sh` script, and *voila*, my system’s all set up.

You can check out my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/Brazier85/dotfiles). Just a heads-up: it's a repo generated by a GitHub pipeline, so some files might be blank or filled with placeholder stuff. But hey, it works!
