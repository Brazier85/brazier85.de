Here we go! At first, I want to tell you some basic facts about me:

## Daily work
In my day-to-day job, I am a tech lead for a small team of IT-Administrators. We take care of the ot-server infrastructure worldwide for our company ([SICK AG](https://sick.com/)). This includes the deployment and maintenance of servers but also making sure, that certain applications and services are always available.
## Free time?
In my free time, I do voluntary work for the Red Cross in Germany, play with my children, and tinker around with my 3D printer and a lot of other tech/it-related stuff.
